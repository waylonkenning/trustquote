# Product Context

This file provides a high-level overview of the project and the expected product that will be created. Initially it is based upon projectBrief.md (if provided) and all other available project-related information in the working directory. This file is intended to be updated as the project evolves, and should be used to inform all other modes of the project's goals and context.

## Project Goal

*   To combat misinformation and deepfakes by establishing a robust framework for verifiable information, based on W3C Verifiable Credentials principles.

## Key Features

*   Core Roles: Publisher, Distributor, Verifier.
*   Mechanisms: Cryptographic signatures (e.g., Ed25519), content hashing (SHA-256), signed metadata, proof of provenance (blockchain anchors, IPFS/Arweave), cryptographic watermarking (ZKPs), and AI deepfake detection.
*   Ecosystem: Universal verification protocols, cross-platform reputation.
*   Privacy: Redactable proofs (BBS+ signatures), anonymous endorsements.

## Overall Architecture

*   The system revolves around three core roles: Publishers, Distributors, and Verifiers.
*   It will utilize a combination of cryptographic techniques, content addressing, and potentially AI for a comprehensive verification process.
*   The architecture will be modular, with distinct services for publishing, distributing, and verifying information.
