    *   Updated publisher API endpoint in [`src/api/publisher_router.py`](src/api/publisher_router.py:1).
    *   Overhauled `PublisherService` in [`src/services/publisher_service/publisher_service.py`](src/services/publisher_service/publisher_service.py:1) for VC processing, JWS verification (using `python-jose`), and DID validation.
    *   Added `python-jose[cryptography]` to [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt:1) and installed.

*   [2025-05-26 18:35:30] - Initial project setup: Defined project structure, recommended technology stack (Python), and created [`README.md`](README.md:1).
*   [2025-05-26 18:37:44] - Created [`README.md`](README.md:1) with initial project information.
*   [2025-05-26 18:39:20] - Implemented basic cryptographic utilities in [`src/core/crypto/crypto_utils.py`](src/core/crypto/crypto_utils.py:1).
*   [2025-05-26 18:42:45] - Implemented Pydantic models in [`src/core/models/models.py`](src/core/models/models.py:1) and schemas in [`src/core/schemas/schemas.py`](src/core/schemas/schemas.py:1).

*   [2025-05-26 19:02:11] - Updated [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt:1) to include `fastapi` and `uvicorn[standard]`.
*   [2025-05-26 19:05:35] - Created FastAPI application structure with initial publisher and verifier endpoints ([`src/main.py`](src/main.py:1), [`src/api/publisher_router.py`](src/api/publisher_router.py:1), [`src/api/verifier_router.py`](src/api/verifier_router.py:1)) and updated [`src/core/crypto/crypto_utils.py`](src/core/crypto/crypto_utils.py:1).
*   [2025-05-26 21:29:00] - Major service implementation and API integration phase:
    *   Implemented `PublisherService` in [`src/services/publisher_service/publisher_service.py`](src/services/publisher_service/publisher_service.py:1).
    *   Implemented `VerifierService` in [`src/services/verifier_service/verifier_service.py`](src/services/verifier_service/verifier_service.py:1).
    *   Integrated `PublisherService` into API endpoints in [`src/api/publisher_router.py`](src/api/publisher_router.py:1).
    *   Integrated `VerifierService` into API endpoints in [`src/api/verifier_router.py`](src/api/verifier_router.py:1).
    *   Created an example script [`examples/run_api_example.py`](examples/run_api_example.py:1) to demonstrate API usage.
    *   Successfully executed and debugged [`examples/run_api_example.py`](examples/run_api_example.py:1), confirming end-to-end functionality.
    *   Previous "Next Steps" regarding service stubs, models, schemas, and crypto utils are now largely complete.

*   [2025-05-27 10:05:20] - Updated [`examples/run_api_example.py`](examples/run_api_example.py:1) to align with the updated FastAPI endpoints (`/api/v1/publish/` and `/api/v1/verifier/verify/`) and DID-centric workflow. The script now correctly generates keys, DIDs, signs a canonical JSON payload, and constructs the appropriate JSON request bodies for `PublishContentRequestSchema` and `VerificationRequestSchema`.
*   [2025-05-27 18:16:43] - Created unit tests for `PublisherService` in [`tests/services/test_publisher_service.py`](tests/services/test_publisher_service.py:1).
*   [2025-05-27 18:25:07] - Updated [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt:1) with `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `pydantic`, `cryptography`, and `pytest`.
*   [2025-05-27 21:04:47] - Configured [`src/main.py`](src/main.py:1) to serve static files from the `static` directory.
## Current Tasks
*   [2025-05-27 18:23:45] - Created [`src/main.py`](src/main.py:1) with the main FastAPI application, including publisher and verifier routers and a root endpoint.
*   [2025-05-27 18:20:42] - Created `src/api/publisher_router.py` with the FastAPI router for publisher operations.
*   [2025-05-27 18:22:03] - Created `src/api/verifier_router.py` with the FastAPI router for verifier operations.
*   [2025-05-27 23:15:00] - Thoroughly test the end-to-end VC publishing flow, including frontend interaction with the updated backend.
*   [2025-05-27 23:15:00] - Refine error handling in `PublisherService` for VC processing, particularly around JWS verification and DID resolution.
*   [2025-05-27 23:15:00] - Implement more robust DID resolution in `PublisherService` if `public_key_pem` is not directly provided in the request (e.g., resolving `did:key` from `vc.proof.verificationMethod`).
*   [2025-05-27 18:18:41] - Created unit tests for `VerifierService` in [`tests/services/test_verifier_service.py`](tests/services/test_verifier_service.py:1), covering core functionality and error handling.
*   [2025-05-26 23:21:02] - Created initial unit tests for `VerifierService` in [`tests/services/test_verifier_service.py`](tests/services/test_verifier_service.py:1).

*   Focus on implementing items in "Next Steps".

## Next Steps

*   Implement comprehensive unit tests for services ([`src/services/publisher_service/publisher_service.py`](src/services/publisher_service/publisher_service.py:1), [`src/services/verifier_service/verifier_service.py`](src/services/verifier_service/verifier_service.py:1)) and core utilities ([`src/core/crypto/crypto_utils.py`](src/core/crypto/crypto_utils.py:1)).
*   Investigate and implement persistent storage (e.g., a database) for published content, replacing the current in-memory store in `PublisherService`.
*   [2025-05-27 18:26:38] - Updated [`README.md`](README.md:1) with project overview, setup instructions, and technologies used.
*   Update [`README.md`](README.md:1) with detailed API usage examples (possibly derived from [`examples/run_api_example.py`](examples/run_api_example.py:1)) and full setup instructions.
[2025-05-27 20:00:05] - FastAPI application started using Uvicorn.
[2025-05-27 21:00:53] - Created `static/css/style.css` with basic styling for the frontend.
[2025-05-27 21:03:10] - Created `static/js/app.js` with client-side logic for key generation, signing, publishing, and verification.
*   [2025-05-27 22:38:17] - Completed Task: Implemented W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) creation in [`static/js/app.js`](static/js/app.js:1). The "Sign and Publish" functionality now constructs a VC with data from the UI, displays it, and sends the VC object to the `/api/v1/publisher/` endpoint. The cryptographic signature for the proof (`jws` or `proofValue`) is currently a placeholder.
